You may, but are not required to, deliver Derivatives to NVIDIA.
1.3 Derivative Models. “Derivative Models” mean all derivative works, adaptations, extensions or enhancements to models licensed as part of the Licensed Materials, works based on such Licensed Materials, or any other model that is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of such Licensed Materials to another model, to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Licensed Materials, including distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Licensed Materials for training the other model. If you create a Derivative Model or modify any files in the Licensed Materials, those modifications must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files such that modifications are not misrepresented as the original Licensed Materials. Except as necessary to give attribution to works as described in this section, you are not granted any trademark license under this Agreement.
2. License Restrictions. Your license to use the Licensed Materials and Derivatives is restricted as stated in this Section 2 (“License Restrictions”).
